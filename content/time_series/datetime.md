Local time is relative to the location in which the data point was recorded which can introduce challenges with comparing data from distant geographic locations. Typically the solution for this problem is to use universal standard time (UTC) which is defined as the local time in England but does not change in response to the location of the data event. To retrieve important data about the true local time (e.g. daily behavior or working hours), offset hours are added to UTC.
